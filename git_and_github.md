# Git and Github

## Branches

### Size

Branches should be as small as possible.  They should contain one feature
or component being work on.  They should have a small number of new or changed files.
This makes pull requests easier to review.

### Names

Names should be concise and clearly define what is being worked on
in the branch.

They should use snake_case.

#### Bad

```
branch_new_feature
branch_fix_error
```

#### Good

```
add_ability_to_rename_account_in_settings
fix_error_when_saving_new_account
```
